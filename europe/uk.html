    <h1>My Time in the United Kingdom</h1>

    <p>Living just north of London was perfect, as we were close enough to train into London for the day,
      but also had easy access to the M1 and M25.<br/>
      We could easily drive anywhere, and also had a train line passing directly through the town.
      <br/><br/>
      We tried to travel every weekend, and some of our highlights are below:
    </p>

    <h2>St Alban's Cathedral</h2>
    <p>This was our local cathedral, and is the site of the longest continuing Christian worship in the UK.</p>

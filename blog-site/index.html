          <h3>Blog post #456</h3>
          <p>Here's a post from my blog.<br></br>Well actually its just some filler text so this site scrolls. It's some text I found from an open tab.<br></br>
            Sometimes formgrabbing isn’t enough: Most banks have security methods to combat man in the middle attacks. I’m just going to explain just one of the many security methods.
            As well as the standard username and password, the user has a security pin number. During login the user is asked for their username, password, and 3 digits from their security pin: The digits required will be chosen at random (Eg. one time they might be asked for the 1st, 3rd, and 9th digit, another time they might be asked for the 2nd, 5th and 8th digit). The digits required change every login, the full security pin is never sent to the bank website, and there is no way to know which digit is which. In order to login to the bank account, the malware would need to be able to get the full security pin,which it can’t get (or can it?).
            Webinjects work in a similar way to a formgrabber, but instead they intercepting data being sent from the website to the browser;
            The data interception is done after the data is decrypted (SSL) but before the browser displays it, giving the malware the ability to modify webpages on the fly.</p>
